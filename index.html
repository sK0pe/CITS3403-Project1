            <h1>Introduction and Background</h1>
            <p>
                EvilCorp is a multinational conglomerate of a company that sells itself as a saviour to the
                as possible. Starting off, the company attempted to operate to this ideal, however once publicly
                floated on the stock exchange, the company was forced to turn to making a profit and nothing else.
            </p>
            <p>
                While pretending to still have lofty goals, the company must privately make as much profit, as
                efficiently as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your role, as a cog in the EvilCorp machine is to observe the blocks of incoming revenue.  When
                the opportunity presents itself, if you can line up the revenue in an efficiently sneaky manner
                it can be stashed in an offshore tax haven as profit that can never be used to improve the quality
                of the products and services provided by EvilCorp.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you can't stash the revenue it becomes public and must be presented as operating costs.
                If this revenue overflows the public perception of operating costs, you will be investigated
                and shut down for fraud.
            </p>
